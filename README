Just whipped this up in a few hours. It's a basic way of getting json files that describe an actionscript class a bit
hack and probably not getting everything yet :P

output folder is 
swcfiles/playerglobal/jsons
or where ever you catalog.xml is a folder will be created along side it with json files
