Just whipped this up in a few hours. It's a basic way of getting json files that describe an actionscript class a bit
hack and probably not getting everything yet :P

input file:
change your swcfile-name.swc to swcfile-name.zip and unzip it
swcfile-name/
-catalog.xml
-library.swf

then run the app and select the catalog.xml to get the data

output folder is 
swcfiles/playerglobal/jsons
or where ever your catalog.xml is a folder will be created along side it with json files
